# Python Basics – Swapping Variables

This repository contains beginner-level Python practice notebooks as I learn Python from scratch using Google Colab.

## 📘 Today's Practice

**Topic:** Swapping Two Variables 
**Notebook:** [`01_Swapping_Variables.ipynb`](https://github.com/aryajayankanichayi/python-learning/blob/main/01_Swapping_Variables.ipynb)

This notebook covers different ways to swap the values of two variables in Python:

### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Swapping using a temporary variable
- Swapping using arithmetic operations
- Swapping using XOR bitwise operator

---

## 🧮 Python Conditions and Loops

- Practiced `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Learned `for` and `while` loops with examples
- Worked with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Solved small logic problems to reinforce loop understanding

## 📘 Arrays – In-Built Methods & Operations

This section explores basic array operations using Python's `array` module and some built-in functions.

### ✅ Concepts Demonstrated:
- buffer_info()
- typecode
- .reverse()
- len()
- Creating squares array
- Sorting using in-built functions
- Factorial using `math`
- User input into array

## 📘 04_Numpy.ipynb – Numpy Operations, Copying Techniques & Max Element Logic

This notebook explores key NumPy functionalities and deepens understanding of array manipulation, copying behaviors, and logic-based problem solving.

### 🔍 Topics Covered:
- **Array creation** using:
  - `linspace()`
  - `arange()`
  - `zeros()`
  - `ones()`
  - `logspace()`
- **Array operations**:
  - Element-wise operations
  - Vectorized calculations
- **Copying arrays – 3 distinct techniques**:
  - **Aliasing**  → both variables point to same data  
  - **View**  → creates a new object, shares data  
  - **Copy**  → creates a completely independent object  
- **Manual max finder (no built-in functions)**:
  - Wrote code to find the **maximum element in a NumPy array** using a basic loop.`

### 📘 05_Basics_in_python.ipynb – Python Basics: Data Types, Collections & Functions

This notebook covers foundational Python concepts with beginner-friendly examples.

#### 🔍 Topics Covered:
- **Variables** – Declaration and assignment
- **Lists** – Indexing, slicing, appending, etc.
- **Tuples** – Immutable collections and usage
- **Sets** – Handling unique elements and set operations
- **Dictionaries** – Key-value pairs, updating/accessing elements
- **Mathematical Functions** – `sqrt()`, `pow()`

### 📘 06_Matrix_Operations.ipynb

This notebook covers fundamental matrix operations using NumPy, including:

- Matrix attributes:
  - `dtype`, `size`, `shape`, `ndim`
- Reshaping arrays:
  - Flattening multi-dimensional arrays using `flatten()`
  - Converting 1D arrays to 3D using `reshape()`
- Matrix functions:
  - `diagonal()`, `min()`, `max()`
- Simple matrix multiplication example

## 📘 07_Functions.ipynb

This notebook includes examples and small programs related to Python functions. It demonstrates defining functions, returning values, using default arguments, and working with lists as function parameters.

### 🔍 Topics Covered

- ✅ Defining and calling functions
- 🔁 Functions returning single and multiple values
- 🧮 Default arguments
- 🔢 Passing a list to a function
- 🔐 Local and global variables

### 🧪 Sample Programs Implemented

- Function to add two numbers
