# Python Basics – Swapping Variables

This repository contains beginner-level Python practice notebooks as I learn Python from scratch using Google Colab.

## 📘 Today's Practice

**Topic:** Swapping Two Variables 
**Notebook:** [`01_Swapping_Variables.ipynb`](https://github.com/aryajayankanichayi/python-learning/blob/main/01_Swapping_Variables.ipynb)

This notebook covers different ways to swap the values of two variables in Python:

### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Swapping using a temporary variable
- Swapping using arithmetic operations
- Swapping using XOR bitwise operator

---

## 🧮 Python Conditions and Loops

- Practiced `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Learned `for` and `while` loops with examples
- Worked with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Solved small logic problems to reinforce loop understanding

## 📘 Arrays – In-Built Methods & Operations

This section explores basic array operations using Python's `array` module and some built-in functions.

### ✅ Concepts Demonstrated:
- buffer_info()
- typecode
- .reverse()
- len()
- Creating squares array
- Sorting using in-built functions
- Factorial using `math`
- User input into array

## 📘 04_Numpy.ipynb – Numpy Operations, Copying Techniques & Max Element Logic

This notebook explores key NumPy functionalities and deepens understanding of array manipulation, copying behaviors, and logic-based problem solving.

### 🔍 Topics Covered:
- **Array creation** using:
  - `linspace()`
  - `arange()`
- **Array operations**:
  - Element-wise operations
  - Vectorized calculations
- **Copying arrays – 3 distinct techniques**:
  - **Aliasing** (`b = a`) → both variables point to same data  
  - **View** (`b = a.view()`) → creates a new object, shares data  
  - **Copy** (`b = a.copy()`) → creates a completely independent object  
- **Manual max finder (no built-in functions)**:
  - Wrote logic to find the **maximum element in a NumPy array** using a basic loop, without using `max()` or `np.max()`

### 💡 Notes:
- Understanding how NumPy handles **memory referencing** helps avoid common bugs during large-scale data manipulation.
- Implementing logic without built-in methods strengthens **problem-solving and core programming** skills.

### ✅ How to Use This:
Clone the repo or open the Colab link. Try:
- Changing array values to see how aliasing or copying affects results
- Modifying the manual max-finder logic to find **min**, **sum**, etc.

## 🚀 What's Next

I’ll continue adding new notebooks daily as I progress through:
- Python basics
- Data structures
- DSA for placements
- Data science mini projects
