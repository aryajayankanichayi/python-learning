# Python Basics – Swapping Variables

This repository contains beginner-level Python practice notebooks as I learn Python from scratch using Google Colab.

## 📘 Today's Practice

**Topic:** Swapping Two Variables 
**Notebook:** `01_Swapping_Variables.ipynb`

This notebook covers different ways to swap the values of two variables in Python:

### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Swapping using a temporary variable
- Swapping using arithmetic operations
- Swapping using XOR bitwise operator

---

## 🧮 Python Conditions and Loops

- Practiced `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Learned `for` and `while` loops with examples
- Worked with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Solved small logic problems to reinforce loop understanding
